# Configure the SpyLogDelegator to use SLF4J. By default, the library expects Log4j2 (see SpyLogFactory#loadSpyLogDelegator),
# which isn't in our classpath. Creating a new instance of DriverSpy would then fail in ServiceLoader.LazyIterator#nextService,
# which would cause the loop in DriverManager#loadInitialDrivers to bail early (in which case some drivers might not be registered).
